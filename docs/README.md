## Note to Reader

### What Am I?

The code in this repository serves as an example for loading a PL path tangle into blender. The
repository also gives an example for storing blender data (along with a PL path and WPTT) into a
database. Storing the data in a database allows for construction of standardized and understandable
test datasets.

### About the Documentation

The following document describes the "rules" and expectation for the tool. The
["Code Comments"](./lib/files/) page contains the technical context descriptions found in the source
files. The ["Use Cases"](./use_cases/) page contains a collection of use cases and a use case
diagram for the tool. The ["Decisions"](./madr/) page contains a collection of
[architectural decision records](https://adr.github.io/madr/) [@Kopp2018] giving context on why this
tool is the way it is.

### Issues

## Planning and Administration

### Tasks

Tasks are tracked as GitHub issues.

### Version Control

The toolchain shall be kept under Git versioning. Development shall take place on branches with
`main` on GitHub as a source of truth. GitHub pull requests shall serve as the arbiter for inclusion
on main with the following quality gates:

- Running and passing the unit test suite.
- Running and passing linting and style enforcers.
- Successful generation of documentation.

#### Release Tagging

The project shall be tagged when a new feature or bug fix is merged into main. The tag shall follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for labels.

```text
vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH
```

### Project Structure

Files and directories shall be lower case, where capital is not required by a tool, and contain no
`' '`.

### Directories of Interest

- Source: This directory contains the source and test code for the tool.
- Docs: This directory contains the high level documentation for the tool.

### Define a Unit

A unit in this project shall be defined as a python module file.

### Quality

The tool and its units shall fail-safe, that is the tool and its units can fail, but the failure
must be detectable. A segfault is okay, an off by one error that computes the wrong value is not.

#### Unit Testing

No unit testing is expected.

#### Integration Testing

Integration tests are expected to be carried out for the tool. Test specifications can be found in
the [test directory](./test/).

### Requirements

#### Functional Requirements

##### Use Cases  

##### Architectural Decisions

Architectural decisions [MADR](<https://github.com/adr/madr>) [@Kopp2018] serve as the primary
documentation for the architecture of the tool.

#### Nonfunctional Requirements

##### Colors

Diagrams included in documentation for features (use case and unit descriptions) are expected to use
the [COLORS](https://clrs.cc) color palette.

##### Technologies

###### Languages and Frameworks

- git
- mermaid.js
- Python
- mkdocs
- Pytest
- prek
- tombi
- rumdl
- ruff
- uv
- MADR[@Kopp2018]

###### Documentation of Implementation

Documentation for code is generated by mkdocstrings.

###### Code Style Guide

The python code in this repository shall be formatted by the bundled ruff configuration.
